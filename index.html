    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <!-- The first section is about primary school -->
    <sh>Early Life</sh>
    <p> This is a website about me. We should probably start from the beginning. I was born on June 16th 2000 in a hospital that no longer exsists therefore I will not bother naming it. I went to a normal primary school where I discovered a love of sports at a young age. Sports I used t play include:
        <ul id="Sports">
            <li>Dance</li>
            <li>Gymnastics</li>
            <li>Netball</li>
            <li>Swimming</li>
        </ul> 
        My favourite part of participating in sports was competing. </p>

        <!-- Secondary school and sixth form education -->
    <h3>Secondary School</h3>
    <p>After trying really hard in the 11+, I was able to get into my dream secondary school. There I met many of the friends I have today. During secondary school I did give up most of my extra- curricular activities due to give me a good work- life balance. However, I did continue dancing, both inside and outside of school. From my secondary education, I completed 11 GCSE's grades A* - C, these were:
        <ul id="GCSEs">
            <li>Maths</li>
            <li>English language</li>
            <li>English literature</li>
            <li>Biology</li>
            <li>Chemistry</li>
            <li>Physics</li>
            <li>Italian</li>
            <li>Dance</li>
            <li>PE</li>
            <li>History</li>
            <li>Religious Studies</li>
        </ul>
        I continued at the same school through sixth form where I studied AS Dance and achieved full a levels in Maths, Chemistry and Biology. 
    </p>

    <!-- university and onwards -->

    <h4>Uni Life</h4>
    <p>After A-levels, I attended the University of Essex to study Mathematics. During my time at univeristy I competed in both dance and cheerleading. I also was a student ambassador meaning that I helped during open days.  </p>
